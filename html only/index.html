<h2>A funny story?</h2>

<p>
    There was this time in the philippines where I and my sister were on the buss,
    she sat at the far end of buss while i was on the front side of the buss.
    Now there was this conductor asking for the fare so i gave him my fare and went on to the next passenger. . .
    a few minutes later he came back and asked again for the fare, and i was like huh?
    i already paid and smiled he looked at my sister and i said yes thats my sister and then he moved away,
    a few minutes he was back again asking for a fare and yet again i refused to pay again and told him i already paid so then he stopped and went away until i and my sister reached our destination and stepped of the buss,
    she then asked me did you pay my fare? and i was like huh? you did not as me before hand that i should pay your fare and you were at the back how should i know?
    (then it all made sense why the conductor asked me for the fare 2 more times and i was like WTF! all this time he wanted me to pay the fare of my sister while i always told him i pad him already =] i felt really weird after) so how funny is it? haha
</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>
    Always ask the person you travel with beforehand if she/he has the money to pay the fare and avoid some stupid conflict in the end =]
